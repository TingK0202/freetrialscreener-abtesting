Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener

At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: "start free trial", 
and "access course materials". If the student clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, 
and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged
unless they cancel first. If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes 
for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.
